In contrast, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) represents a theoretical form of intelligence that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. AGI would have the capacity for abstract thinking, reasoning, and adaptability similar to human cognitive abilities, making it far more versatile than today's AI systems.

They capture the semantic relationships and patterns in the data, where similar items are placed closer together in the vector space. In machine learning, embeddings are used to convert complex data into numerical form that models can process more easily. For example, word embeddings represent words based on their meanings and contexts, allowing models to understand relationships like synonyms or analogies. Embeddings are widely used in tasks like natural language processing, recommendation systems, and image recognition to improve model performance and efficiency.",

Unlike training, inference involves the model applying what it has learned to make decisions without needing examples of the exact result. In essence, inference is the AI model actively functioning. For example, a self-driving car recognizing a stop sign on a road it has never encountered before demonstrates inference.

Unlike traditional databases that handle structured data, vector databases excel at managing unstructured data by enabling fast similarity searches, where vectors are compared to find those that are most similar to a query.
